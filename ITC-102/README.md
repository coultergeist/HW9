Bathroom Buddy
==============

CUSTOMERS/APP USERS

Wouldn't it be nice to know where all of the restrooms are in a city? From Honey Buckets to ones in Starbucks that don't require keys to bathrooms like the ones in BMW dealers. Well, Bathroom Buddy is here to help. Customers and users of the app can find public restrooms, enter ones that they've found, and even review the bathrooms. Instead of the star system, bathrooms can get up to five squeaky-clean shiny sponges, or five poop-face emojis. Tell fellow public bathroom users if a passcode or key is needed, if the place asks that you provide business before doing your business, if it's only the kind of bathroom you should use if you REALLY need to go, etc. Finally, an app that will tell you one of the most important pieces of information for human function, whether you are out running errands, bar hopping with your friends, or acting as a tourist in a new city.

When you level up you'll recieve a 15% discount on the next level.

Level 1: "Basic Bathroom Etiquette." For just $25 we'll get you on the right track. A team will visit your place of business and provide feedback on how your spot scores. Points are given for many things but include accessability, cleanliness, and character. There's a lot more to it than you think and we'll teach you what customers look for most and what, surprisingly, will motivate them to never return. At level 1 we can't help you turn those reviews around but you'll begin to impress returning and new customers on a daily basis.

Level 2: "Refresh to Impress."  $39.99- Our team will design a customized maintainance plan detailing how to keep your bathroom at its very best.  Replacing airfreshers, paint-touch ups, seasonal wall-art, tighting fixtures, are a few of the details we'll take of; don't worry, you won't have to lift a finger, our team will do all the work! AND The frequency of "Refreshers" will be directly proportionate with the amount of traffic, ensuring your customers a refreshing experience everytime!

Level 3: "Be Recognized." For an additional $10, your store will be listed on Bathroom Buddies's app "Restroom Locator." "Restroom Locator" allows the public to locate and rate restrooms. And with Level 1 and 2 under your belt, you can rest assured that you will be receiving positive reviews. This level serves to directly increase traffic to your shop. Customers who have never been to your shop will enter with a favorable outlook; customers who have been to your shop in the past and had a negative experience will reconsider their outlook and be more likely to return someday.
